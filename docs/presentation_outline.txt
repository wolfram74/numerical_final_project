things to talk about:
  model description:
    potential energy interaction
      1/r * e^-r
    drag
      -gamma * v
    confinement
    driving
  implementation:
    cell lists
    language of choice
    testing habits
    results:
      movie and/or text files parsed into graphs
  model parameters:
    dimensions of confinement
    density
  observations:
    heat map of effect on potential energy
    high frequency => low effect
    low frequency => moderate effect
    oblique angles => low effect
  further inquiries:
    higher driving force at obliquge angles
    long simulations at very low frequencies
    more resolution in angle space
    narrower and deeper
