a particle class that has properties:
  position_velocity_state (numpy array)
  time (float)
  neighbor_ids (list of ints, index value in container class)
  kernels (5 numpy arrays [first one is 0's])
  reference to container class
  has functions for:
    calculating separation between two working states
    calculating it's address for the cell list



a system class that has properties
  a list of particles
  a function that given a particle state and a time returns
    cumulative force of drag, confinement and driving
  a function that populates the cell list

calculating forces at some state involves
  generating the cell list
  for each particle
    using the cell list to find neighbors

if we wanted to use an RK4 for the particles
  each particle would need to tabulate it's 4 kernels
  each kernel is the sum of
    confinement force
    driving force
    drag
    interaction forces
  kernels are the deltas for position_veleocity_state 4-vector
  to do a time step at current_time
    make a cell list with a cell width of 2 in container class
    have particles determine their cell list address
    populate cell list with ID's
    have particles look up relevant neighbors ID's
    for kernel_num 1 through 4
      for each particle
        current_kernel is blanked
        working_state is current_state+(kernel_num-1)
        working_time is current_time + appropriate_time_step
        calculate confinement_force at working_state
        calculate driving_force at working_state and working_time
        calculate drag at working_state
        interaction_forces is blanked
        for each neighbor
          add to interaction_forces from each neighbor
        sum all forces and multiply by step size

have particle density of about .25
